Technologies Used: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually engaging experience. JavaScript handles the game logic, animations, and user interactions.

How to Play: The game starts by flashing a color in a random sequence. The player must click the colors in the correct order as the sequence gets longer with each round. If the player makes a mistake, the game resets, and they have to start over.
